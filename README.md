# hedera-eth-rpc

An Ethereum JSON-RPC API bridge to Hedera network.

## Inspiration

MetaMask is the world's leading non-custodian crypto wallet.

MetaMask provides a window into ETH-compatible blockchains for millions of users who use it to make token and NFT transfers. It also allows the creation and actioning of smart contract functionality, used by many DeFi applications.

I don't really want to reinvent the wheel for Hedera. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just use hugely popular wallet with a Hedera-ETH JSON-RPC compatible bridge?

Its really not that hard is it?
